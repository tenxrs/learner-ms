This gives you a feeling for general law subjects before you commit to studying law. It also develops your knowledge and skills in other disciplines, which will be useful when you practise law.
      If you want to work in corporate law, either for a law firm or in the legal department of large organisations, you should do a BCom(Law) with a second major in Finance, Management, Accounting, Taxation, or any other BCom major.
